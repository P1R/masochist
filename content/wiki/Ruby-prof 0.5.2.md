[ruby-prof 0.5.2](/wiki/ruby-prof_0.5.2) was released on 19 July 2007.

# Changes in 0.5.2

-   This release includes a rails_plugin that makes it easier to profile Rails applications. The plugin was mistakenly left out of the 0.5.1 release.
-   Add rails_plugin into release.

# Changes in 0.5.1

I include the 0.5.1 change list here as well because 0.5.2 came hot on the heels of 0.5.1, and I didn't get a chance to install 0.5.1 beforehand:

-   Performance
    -   Significantly reduced the number of thread lookups by caching the last executed thread.
-   Fixes
    -   Properly escape method names in HTML reports
    -   Fix use of -m and --min-percent command line switches
    -   Default source file information to ruby_runtime\#0 for c calls
    -   Moved rails_plugin to top level so it is more obvious
    -   Updated rails_plugin to write reports to the current Rails log directory
    -   Added additional tests
