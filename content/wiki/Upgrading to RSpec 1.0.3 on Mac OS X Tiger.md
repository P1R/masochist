These notes were made while upgrading from [RSpec 1.0.2](/wiki/RSpec_1.0.2) to [RSpec 1.0.3](/wiki/RSpec_1.0.3) on [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) [Tiger](/wiki/Tiger).

Unlike the last upgrade (see "[Upgrading to RSpec 1.0.2 on Mac OS X Tiger](/wiki/Upgrading_to_RSpec_1.0.2_on_Mac_OS_X_Tiger)"), there was no corresponding [Spec::UI](/wiki/Spec%3a%3aUI) upgrade although I did simultaneously upgrade to [ZenTest 3.6.0](/wiki/ZenTest_3.6.0) (see "[Upgrading to ZenTest 3.6.0 using RubyGems](/wiki/Upgrading_to_ZenTest_3.6.0_using_RubyGems)").

# Pre-testing

First double check that all [specs](/wiki/specs) are passing for [Walrus](/wiki/Walrus). This is a good check because there are a _lot_ of specifications, many of them containing numerous assertions:

    # from the top-level directory of the Walrus source tree:
    rake spec

# Download and install

    sudo gem install rspec

I had exactly the same problems that I did trying to install [ZenTest 3.6.0](/wiki/ZenTest_3.6.0); namely:

    ERROR:  While executing gem ... (OpenURI::HTTPError)
        404 Not Found

So either [RubyForge](/wiki/RubyForge) is having technical difficulties or there is some other problem between my local computer and the remote host (not impossible given that I believe that my [ISP](/wiki/ISP) interposes a transparent proxy between me and the outside world). So I decided to download and install manually just as I did with [ZenTest](/wiki/ZenTest):

    # downloading
    wget "http://rubyforge.iasi.roedu.net/files/rspec/rspec-1.0.3.gem"

    # installing
    sudo gem install rspec-1.0.3.gem

## Output

    Successfully installed rspec, version 1.0.3

# Post-testing

    # run the specs again
    rake spec

# [TextMate](/wiki/TextMate)

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/RSpec.tmbundle
    svn up

## Output

There were no changes since the last [RSpec](/wiki/RSpec) release:

    At revision 2040.

## After updating

Normally, if [TextMate](/wiki/TextMate) is running, from the [TextMate](/wiki/TextMate) "Bundles" menu, open the "Bundle Editor" submenu and select "Reload Bundles". But in this case as there were no changes this should not be necessary.

# [Rails](/wiki/Rails)

I have a [Rails](/wiki/Rails) project where [rspec](/wiki/rspec) is installed as a plug-in. The `--force` switch is necessary in order to install over the previously installed copy:

    # from inside the Rails application top-level directory
    script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_1_0_3/rspec
    script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_1_0_3/rspec_on_rails

See if any other changes are necessary:

    script/generate rspec --pretend

## Output

There were no significant changes:

# [Autotest](/wiki/Autotest) notes

[RSpec 1.0.3](/wiki/RSpec_1.0.3) is listed as a bugfix release and so at first I thought it doesn't bring any new features. But [ZenTest 3.6.0](/wiki/ZenTest_3.6.0) is out and it incorporates a new mechanism that offers better integration with [RSpec](/wiki/RSpec). [David Chelimsky](/wiki/David_Chelimsky) had [previously said](http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rspec-users/2007-May/001700.html) on the [rspec-users](/wiki/rspec-users) mailing list that the next release after this new [ZenTest](/wiki/ZenTest) version will include changes to work with thew new mechanism. This will involve undoing some of the set-up work previously undertaken and described in "[Setting up autotest](/wiki/Setting_up_autotest)" and "[Using autotest with Rails](/wiki/Using_autotest_with_Rails)".

To my surprise, I found out from the [mailing list post](http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rspec-users/2007-May/001742.html) that [RSpec 1.0.3](/wiki/RSpec_1.0.3) _is_ the release that brings better [autotest](/wiki/autotest) integration.

> ZenTest-3.6.0 boasts a new autodiscovery and plugin model that other frameworks can register with and plug into. RSpec-1.0.3 ships with the necessary plugin code, so all you need to do is download and go.

This is really fantastic news. I was pleasantly surprised to see that [Autotest](/wiki/Autotest) worked anyway without any changes, but I went ahead and removed the now unnecessary customization that I had previously done.

In the case of non-[Rails](/wiki/Rails) apps, this amounted to removing the `rspec_autotest.rb` file that I had installed in the project root. As long as your application is structured parallel `lib` and `spec` folders then it all should work automatically. In the case of [Rails](/wiki/Rails) apps no changes were necessary at all.
