A [hard reset](/wiki/hard_reset) is any kind of abrupt power-down in which a computer isn't allowed or able to go through the normal shutdown process of terminating applications and processes, closing files, completing pending filesystem transactions and so on.

There are a number of possible variations of the [hard reset](/wiki/hard_reset), such as:

-   the external power failure (which can be largely mitigated with a [UPS](/wiki/UPS))
-   the "forced reset", where the [operating system](/wiki/operating_system) becomes unsalvageably frozen and the user is obliged to force an immediate power-down with the power button or physical reset switch
-   the "plug yank", in which the system becomes so throughly wedged that even the power button and physical reset switch stop working; in this case literally _yanking_ the power lead may have some therapeutic value

I maintain a journal of my experiences with such failures in the [Involuntary Reboot Log](/wiki/Involuntary_Reboot_Log).
