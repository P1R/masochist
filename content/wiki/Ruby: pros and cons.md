# Things I like about Ruby

-   Total object-oriented; even `1`, `nil`, `true` and `false` are objects.
-   Looks very clean because punctuation is minimal
    -   Statements don't need semi-colons to terminate them (but you can put them on if you want)
    -   Statements automatically terminated by newlines, unless continuation is obvious:

<!-- -->

    a_statement; another_statement
    puts "this statement spans two lines " +
         "thanks to the plus sign on the line above"

-   Various, natural ways of expressing flow control decisions:

<!-- -->

    if object.nil?
      do_something
    else
      do_something_else
    end

    do_something if this?

    do_something unless that?

    return if variable = object.method

-   No need to declare variables before use
-   Built-in RSS support in the standard library
-   Advanced flow control structures

Apart from the basic `while` loops and `case` statements, [Ruby](/wiki/Ruby) also provides exception handling (`raise` and `rescue`) for unexpected or error conditions, `throw`/`catch` as an alternative means of jumping out to a wider scope (generally not used for error conditions), and finally, [continuations](/wiki/continuations) which can be used (or abused) to do pretty much anything you want.

[Continuations](/wiki/Continuations) are a special favorite of mine as they allow you to jump back to a previously signalled place in the call stack with virtually no limitations (hence my statement about "use or abuse").

# Things I don't like about Ruby

-   No need to declare variables before use (can lead to hard to spot run-time errors):

<!-- -->

    char_count = foo_bar
    needed_chars = char_count * 2
    spare = 1
    a = Array.new(neeeded_chars + spare) # note the spelling error

-   Autogenerated accessors are great if and only if you want objects passed in by reference; if you want to copy the values then things are a royal pain.

<!-- -->

    # this will set up autogenerated accessors (by reference)
    attr_accessor :ivar1

    # this is will break if you pass nil
    # the problem is that nil raises an exception if you send it a dup message
    # (nil is actually a singleton object)
    def ivar2=(newvalue)
      @ivar2 = newvalue.dup
    end

    # this obvious workaround fails
    # nil devilishly responds "true" here, then raises
    def ivar3=(newvalue)
      if newvalue.respond_to?("dup")
        @ivar3 = newvalue.dup
      else
        @ivar3 = newvalue
      end
    end

    # this workaround fails too
    # it fixes the problem with nil, but breaks if you pass a Fixnum
    def ivar4=(newvalue)
      if newvalue and newvalue.respond_to?("dup")
        @ivar4 = newvalue.dup
      else
        @ivar4 = newvalue
      end
    end

    # it seems that the only work around is to catch exceptions in the accessor (yuck!)
    # as an Objective-C/Cocoa programmer, this really looks hideous
    def ivar5=(newvalue)
      begin
        @ivar5 = newvalue.dup
      rescue TypeError
        @ivar = newvalue
      end
    end

    # slightly better
    def ivar6=(newvalue)
      @ivar6 = newvalue.dup
    rescue TypeError
      @ivar = newvalue
    end

    # shortest form I've found so far
    def ivar7=(newvalue)
      @ivar7 = (newvalue.dup rescue newvalue)
    end
