# Episode 1

I was getting errors like this when trying to sync to an Exchange server (ugh):

```
C: 2/5  B: 2/4  M: +0/0 *0/0 #0/0  S: +64/64 *1/1 #0/0
Error: UIDVALIDITY of master changed (got 148, expected 92)
C: 4/5  B: 4/6  M: +0/0 *0/0 #0/0  S: +65/65 *1/1 #0/0
Error: UIDVALIDITY of master changed (got 117, expected 82)
C: 4/5  B: 5/6  M: +0/0 *0/0 #0/0  S: +65/65 *1/1 #0/0
Error: UIDVALIDITY of master changed (got 144, expected 89)
C: 5/5  B: 6/6  M: +0/0 *0/0 #0/0  S: +65/65 *1/1 #0/0
```

According to [this mailing list thread](https://www.mail-archive.com/isync-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00783.html):

Hm. "you lose all messages". Scary stuff. Nevertheless, I figured I'd give it a try:

```
$ cd ~/.mail
$ grep -R MasterUidValidity *
Work/.mbsyncstate:MasterUidValidity 14
Work.Archive/.mbsyncstate:MasterUidValidity 82
Work.Drafts/.mbsyncstate:MasterUidValidity 89
Work.Sent/.mbsyncstate:MasterUidValidity 11
Work.Spam/.mbsyncstate:MasterUidValidity 92
Work.Trash/.mbsyncstate:MasterUidValidity 12
```

So, I went in, changed the numbers, ran the sync again, and everything seemed to work fine.

# Episode 2

This time messages like:

```
Error: channel Catchall, master Archive: UIDVALIDITY genuinely changed (at UID 438231).
```

[Mailing list thread](https://sourceforge.net/p/isync/mailman/message/36070604/):

> 1. Locate the offending UID (zzz) in .mbsyncstate in Mailbox xxx/yyy - find zzz in the first column and note the corresponding local ID in the second column
> 2. Locate the message file in the Mailbox (ls | grep "U=id", replacing id with the ID found in step 1). Move it out of the way, e.g. into a temporary directory outside the Maildir
> 3. Run mbsync. This yields a message Notice: channel xxx, master yyy: Recovered from change of UIDVALIDITY.
> 4. Move the offending message back into the Maildir
> 5. Run mbsync again.

Apparently, bad advice (read the full thread). Didn't work.

As only Exchange seems to break in this way, and most of the old archived messages aren't something I'll ever need to consult again, I removed the message _and_ the line from the `.mbsyncstate` file. Didn't work.

Second to last resort: blow away `.mbsyncstate` for that directory. Didn't work.

Last resort: blow away all mail and resync.
