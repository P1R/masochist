# Fixing Firefox breakage

As [noted here](http://www.spacevatican.org/2008/9/27/selenium-and-firefox-3), the currently shipping version of the Selenium gem doesn't work with Firefox 3. As the [Selenium website](http://seleniumhq.org/) was down at the time of writing, I manually edited the "maximum version" limits of the jar file inside the gem:

    mkdir /tmp/selenium
    cd /tmp/selenium
    jar xf /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/Selenium-1.1.14/lib/selenium/openqa/selenium-server.jar.txt

    # could have used sed, but wanted to visually inspect the files:
    find . -name '*.rdf' -exec vim {} \;

    find . -name '*.rdf' -exec \
      sudo jar uf /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/Selenium-1.1.14/lib/selenium/openqa/selenium-server.jar.txt {} \;
