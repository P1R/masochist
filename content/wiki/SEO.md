[SEO](/wiki/SEO)Â or [Search Engine Optimization](/wiki/Search_Engine_Optimization) is the practice of manipulating [web](/wiki/web) content to increase its page rank with popular search engines such as that provided by [Google](/wiki/Google).

Many people attempt to make money by offering [SEO](/wiki/SEO) consulting services.

# Personal views

Companies like [Google](/wiki/Google) are successful because their search engine delivers high-quality search results; it is in their interests to return the kinds of results that people genuinely want. The market relationships are quite simple:

-   The more people want to advertise with [Google](/wiki/Google), the more successful it will be
-   Advertisers will choose [Google](/wiki/Google) if [Google](/wiki/Google) can provide them with maximum exposure
-   [Google](/wiki/Google) maximizes exposure by attracting users
-   [Google](/wiki/Google) attracts users by giving them what they want

This is a very healthy symbiotic relationship in which users, advertisers, and [Google](/wiki/Google) acting as a broker between them, get what they want.

I personally believe that [SEO](/wiki/SEO) is detrimental to users because it explicitly seeks to subvert [Google](/wiki/Google)'s goal (of locating the content that users want to find) and instead cause [Google](/wiki/Google) to return the results that the [SEO](/wiki/SEO) consultant wants them to see. If a [SEO](/wiki/SEO) consultant succeeds in increasing the page rank of content beyond its real merits, then the user is harmed because he or she doesn't get access to the best possible results.

Rather than waste money on [SEO](/wiki/SEO) services, I recommend that people follow the single most important bit of [search engine optimization](/wiki/search_engine_optimization) advice: _publish worthwhile content_. If you do that, then people will come.

And to people considering getting into the [SEO](/wiki/SEO) business, I recommend you look into a less ethically dubious line of work; there are plenty of interesting, rewarding, financially lucrative fields in [IT](/wiki/IT) that don't have that kind of question mark hanging over them.
