# Pre-testing

First double check that all [specs](/wiki/specs) are passing for [Walrus](/wiki/Walrus). This is a good check because there are a _lot_ of specifications, many of them containing numerous assertions:

    # from the top-level directory of the Walrus source tree:
    rake spec

# Download and install

    sudo gem install rspec

# [Rails](/wiki/Rails)

I have a [Rails](/wiki/Rails) project where [rspec](/wiki/rspec) is installed as a plug-in. The `--force` switch is necessary in order to install over the previously installed copy:

    # from inside the Rails application top-level directory
    script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_0_9_4/rspec
    script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_0_9_4/rspec_on_rails

# Notes for 0.9.4

> This release introduces massive improvements to Spec::Ui - the user interface functional testing extension to RSpec. There are also some minor bug fixes to the RSpec core.

# Changelog for 0.9.4

-   Massive improvements to Spec::Ui. Complete support for all Watir's ie.xxx(how, what) methods. Inline screenshots and HTML.
-   Reactivated --timeout, which had mysteriously been deactivated in a recent release.
-   Fixed \#10669 Kernel\#describe override does not cover Kernel\#context
-   Applied \#10636 Added spec for OptionParser in Runner (Patch from Scott Taylor)
-   Added \#10516 should_include should be able to accept multiple items
-   Applied \#10631 redirect_to matcher doesn't respect request.host (Patch from Tim Lucas)
-   Each formatter now flushes their own IO. This is to avoid buffering of output.
-   Fixed \#10670 IVarProxy\#delete raises exception when instance variable does not exist
