Many Ruby methods follow a "bang" pattern to differentiate destructive messages (which alter the object to which they are sent) from non-destructive ones (which do not alter the receiving object).

# Example

The `capitalize` method of the `String` class returns a capitalized _copy_ of a string, but the `capitalize!` (bang variant) method directly modifies the string object itself.
