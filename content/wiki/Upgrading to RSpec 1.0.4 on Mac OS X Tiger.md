These notes were made while upgrading from [RSpec 1.0.3](/wiki/RSpec_1.0.3) to [RSpec 1.0.4](/wiki/RSpec_1.0.4) on [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) [Tiger](/wiki/Tiger).

Like the last upgrade (see "[Upgrading to RSpec 1.0.3 on Mac OS X Tiger](/wiki/Upgrading_to_RSpec_1.0.3_on_Mac_OS_X_Tiger)"), there was no corresponding [Spec::UI](/wiki/Spec%3a%3aUI) upgrade.

# Pre-testing

First double check that all [specs](/wiki/specs) are passing for [Walrus](/wiki/Walrus). This is a good check because there are a _lot_ of specifications, many of them containing numerous assertions:

    # from the top-level directory of the Walrus source tree:
    rake spec

# Download and install

    sudo gem install rspec

## Output

# Post-testing

    # run the specs again
    rake spec

# [TextMate](/wiki/TextMate)

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/RSpec.tmbundle
    svn up

## Output

There were no changes since the last [RSpec](/wiki/RSpec) release:

    At revision 2060.

## After updating

Normally, if [TextMate](/wiki/TextMate) is running, from the [TextMate](/wiki/TextMate) "Bundles" menu, open the "Bundle Editor" submenu and select "Reload Bundles". But in this case as there were no changes this should not be necessary.

# [Rails](/wiki/Rails)

I have a [Rails](/wiki/Rails) project where [rspec](/wiki/rspec) is installed as a plug-in. The `--force` switch is necessary in order to install over the previously installed copy:

    # from inside the Rails application top-level directory
    script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_1_0_4/rspec
    script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_1_0_4/rspec_on_rails

See if any other changes are necessary:

    script/generate rspec --pretend

## Output

          exists  spec
    overwrite spec/spec_helper.rb? [Ynaqd] d

# Cleaning up old versions of installed [gems](/wiki/gems)

I also took the opportunity to clean up some older versions of the installed [gems](/wiki/gems).

    sudo gem cleanup
