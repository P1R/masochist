Used to store [graphs](/wiki/graphs), especially dense graphs. (For sparse graphs, see "[Adjacency list](/wiki/Adjacency_list)").

-   for a graph with _n_ vertices and _m_ edges, we store an _n_ by _n_ matrix
-   a 1 or similar value at position _i, j_ in the matrix is used to indicate the presence of an edge between vertices _i_ and _j_
-   alternatively, for a weighted graph, we can use the edge weight as the value
-   directed graphs can use the sign of the value (positive or negative) to indicate the direction of the edge
-   for maximal density, we can use as little as a single bit to encode each value (in the case of an undirected, unweighted graph)

The matrix itself can be stored in any convenient way; it could be a bit string, or a multidimensional array. If the matrix is relatively sparse, we can look at using a special-purpose data structure to represent the sparse matrix.

# Operations

-   enumerating the edges of a vertex requires a linear scan of a matrix row or column (linear in the number of vertices)
-   looking up the endpoints of an edge can be done in constant time
