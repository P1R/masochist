wget http://dfn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/flac/flac-1.2.1.tar.gz tar xzvf flac-1.2.1.tar.gz cd flac-1.2.1 ./configure --disable-asm-optimizations && make && make check sudo make install

There actually were some minor test failures in `make check`, but they look harmless enough so I proceded with the install.
