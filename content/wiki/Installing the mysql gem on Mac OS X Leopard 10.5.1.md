As noted in my [Leopard set-up notes](/wiki/Leopard_set-up_notes), I couldn't get [MySQL](/wiki/MySQL) to build on [Leopard](/wiki/Leopard)Â 10.5.0, but I could with 10.5.1.

On upgrading to Rails 2.0RC2 (see "[Upgrading to Rails 2.0RC2 on Mac OS X Leopard](/wiki/Upgrading_to_Rails_2.0RC2_on_Mac_OS_X_Leopard)") I noticed that they'd added some instructions to the `config/database.yml` file for installing the mysql [gem](/wiki/gem) on Leopard:

    sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386" gem install mysql -- --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config

Looks like this advice probably originated from [here](http://trac.macosforge.org/projects/ruby/wiki/Troubleshooting).

But note, when I just did a plain `./configure && make` for MySQL, the `mysql_config` tool was _not_ installed at that path, but at `/usr/local/bin/mysql_config` instead.

So, in my case, I had to do this (note the different value for `--with-mysql-config`):

    $ sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386" gem install mysql -- --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/bin/mysql_config

    Successfully installed mysql-2.7

# Update

Some time later I started seeing entries like this in my [Rails](/wiki/Rails) logs:

    WARNING: You're using the Ruby-based MySQL library that ships with Rails.
    This library is not suited for production. Please install the C-based MySQL
    library instead (gem install mysql).

Yet it does seem that it is installed:

    $ gem list | grep mysql
    mysql (2.7)

Given that a later version is available:

    $ gem list --remote|grep mysql
    activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter (0.7.1, 0.7, 0.6)
    do_mysql (0.2.3, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.2.0)
    jdbc-mysql (5.0.4)
    mysql (2.7.3, 2.7.1, 2.7, 2.6, 2.5.1)
    mysql_replication_adapter (0.4.0, 0.2.0, 0.1.1, 0.1.0)
    mysql_retry_lost_connection (0.0.1)

I decided to proceeded with a reinstallation. My initial attempt naturally didn't work, as I had already forgotten about the workaround necessary to install the [gem](/wiki/gem) on [Leopard](/wiki/Leopard):

    $ sudo gem install mysql

A quick [Google](/wiki/Google) (too quick, seeing as I didn't find this page again reminding me that I'd already been through this once before!) suggested that I need to do the following, which also didn't work:

    $ sudo gem install mysql -- --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config

The `install_name_tool` trick doesn't seem to be necessary with this version of the [gem](/wiki/gem) because the reference to the `libmysqlclient.15.dylib` is already pointing to the right place:

    bash-3.2# otool -L /usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.15.0.0.dylib

Points of interest:

-   The warnings in the [Rails](/wiki/Rails) log have gone away
-   But notice that the reported version of the [gem](/wiki/gem) is still 2.7, just like the one that was already installed, and not 2.7.3 as is reported as being available by `gem list --remote`
