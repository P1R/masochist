[RSpec 1.0.1](/wiki/RSpec_1.0.1)Â was released on 24 May 2007. It was immediately followed up (the same day) by [RSpec 1.0.2](/wiki/RSpec_1.0.2).

# Release notes

> This is a maintenance release with mostly cleaning up, and one minor enhancement - Modules are automatically included when described directly.

# Changelog

-   Renamed Spec::Rails' rspec_resource generator to rspec_scaffold.
-   Removed Spec::Rails' be_feed matcher since it's based on assert_select_feed which is not part of Rails (despite that docs for assert_select_encoded says it is).
-   describe(SomeModule) will include that module in the examples. Like for Spec::Rails helpers, but now also in core.
-   Header in HTML report will be yellow instead of red if there is one failed example
-   Applied \#10951 Odd instance variable name in rspec_model template (patch from Kyle Hargraves)
-   Improved integration with autotest (Patches from Ryan Davis and David Goodland)
-   Some small fixes to make all specs run on JRuby.
