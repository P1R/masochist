# Protecting controller actions

Any public method in a controller class can be called from a web browser. For example, consider the following method:

    class UsersController < ApplicationController
      def nuke_database
        User.destroy_all
      end
    end

This method can be called from a browser using a [URL](/wiki/URL) like: <http://example.com/users/nuke_database/>

This is because the default routing in `config/routes.rb` allows it:

    map.connect ':controller/:action/:id'

When you try to access such a URL [Rails](/wiki/Rails) will look for a view template at `app/views/users/nuke_database.rhtml` and most likely not find it. Nevertheless, by the time the view-related error occurs the body of the method will already have been executed. It is therefore absolutely essential that you declare all methods that aren't public actions as `protected`:

    class UsersController < ApplicationController
      def index
        # public method
      end

    protected

      def nuke_database
        User.destroy_all
      end
    end
