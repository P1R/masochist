    Git v1.6.5.3 Release Notes
    ==========================

    Fixes since v1.6.5.2
    --------------------

    * info/grafts file didn't ignore trailing CR at the end of lines.

    * Packages generated on newer FC were unreadable by older versions of
      RPM as the new default is to use stronger hash.

    * output from "git blame" was unreadable when the file ended in an
      incomplete line.

    * "git add -i/-p" didn't handle deletion of empty files correctly.

    * "git clone" takes up to two parameters, but did not complain when
      given more arguments than necessary and silently ignored them.

    * "git cvsimport" did not read files given as command line arguments
      correctly when it is run from a subdirectory.

    * "git diff --color-words -U0" didn't work correctly.

    * The handling of blank lines at the end of file by "git diff/apply
      --whitespace" was inconsistent with the other kinds of errors.
      They are now colored, warned against, and fixed the same way as others.

    * There was no way to allow blank lines at the end of file without
      allowing extra blanks at the end of lines.  You can use blank-at-eof
      and blank-at-eol whitespace error class to specify them separately.
      The old trailing-space error class is now a short-hand to set both.

    * "-p" option to "git format-patch" was supposed to suppress diffstat
      generation, but it was broken since 1.6.1.

    * "git imap-send" did not compile cleanly with newer OpenSSL.

    * "git help -a" outside of a git repository was broken.

    * "git ls-files -i" was supposed to be inverse of "git ls-files" without -i
      with respect to exclude patterns, but it was broken since 1.6.5.2.

    * "git ls-remote" outside of a git repository over http was broken.

    * "git rebase -i" gave bogus error message when the command word was
      misspelled.

    * "git receive-pack" that is run in response to "git push" did not run
      garbage collection nor update-server-info, but in larger hosting sites,
      these almost always need to be run.  To help site administrators, the
      command now runs "gc --auto" and "u-s-i" by setting receive.autogc
      and receive.updateserverinfo configuration variables, respectively.

    * Release notes spelled the package name with incorrect capitalization.

    * "gitweb" did not escape non-ascii characters correctly in the URL.

    * "gitweb" showed "patch" link even for merge commits.

    * "gitweb" showed incorrect links for blob line numbers in pathinfo mode.

    Other minor documentation updates are included.
