    GIT v1.6.3.2 Release Notes
    ==========================

    Fixes since v1.6.3.1
    --------------------

     * A few codepaths picked up the first few bytes from an sha1[] by
       casting the (char *) pointer to (int *); GCC 4.4 did not like this,
       and aborted compilation.

     * Some unlink(2) failures went undiagnosed.

     * The "recursive" merge strategy misbehaved when faced rename/delete
       conflicts while coming up with an intermediate merge base.

     * The low-level merge algorithm did not handle a degenerate case of
       merging a file with itself using itself as the common ancestor
       gracefully.  It should produce the file itself, but instead
       produced an empty result.

     * GIT_TRACE mechanism segfaulted when tracing a shell-quoted aliases.

     * OpenBSD also uses st_ctimspec in "struct stat", instead of "st_ctim".

     * With NO_CROSS_DIRECTORY_HARDLINKS, "make install" can be told not to
       create hardlinks between $(gitexecdir)/git-$builtin_commands and
       $(bindir)/git.

     * command completion code in bash did not reliably detect that we are
       in a bare repository.

     * "git add ." in an empty directory complained that pathspec "." did not
       match anything, which may be technically correct, but not useful.  We
       silently make it a no-op now.

     * "git add -p" (and "patch" action in "git add -i") was broken when
       the first hunk that adds a line at the top was split into two and
       both halves are marked to be used.

     * "git blame path" misbehaved at the commit where path became file
       from a directory with some files in it.

     * "git for-each-ref" had a segfaulting bug when dealing with a tag object
       created by an ancient git.

     * "git format-patch -k" still added patch numbers if format.numbered
       configuration was set.

     * "git grep --color ''" did not terminate.  The command also had
       subtle bugs with its -w option.

     * http-push had a small use-after-free bug.

     * "git push" was converting OFS_DELTA pack representation into less
       efficient REF_DELTA representation unconditionally upon transfer,
       making the transferred data unnecessarily larger.

     * "git remote show origin" segfaulted when origin was still empty.

    Many other general usability updates around help text, diagnostic messages
    and documentation are included as well.
