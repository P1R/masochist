This is a list of user-visible changes to the custom [Rails](/wiki/Rails) application running this site since it went public. These really are only the _user-visible_ changes; there are generally _lots_ of other modifications made "under the hood".

Eventually I plan to make the code for the site [open source](/wiki/open_source), so I won't need to manually maintain this list any more.

# 0.3: 24 April 2009

-   Covered [here](/blog/site-updates).

# April 2009

I've started tagging deployments in the [Git](/wiki/Git) repo. Basically, after a deploy has been up and running for a few days and is known to be "good" I go back and tag the corresponding revision. So far there are two tags:

-   0.2: deployed 1 April 2009
-   0.1: deployed 26 March 2009

From here on instead of manually recording changes I'll just be posting Git commit logs showing what changes between tags.

# March 2009

-   [Ticket \#1237](/issues/1237): 'Auto-adjust "heading level" according to context'
-   Update to Rails 2.3.2
-   Flashes are now [JavaScript-backed](/blog/javascript-backed-flash), which means I can start turning on page-caching in more places and users will see faster page load times
-   Ported fix for [XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/2/28/xss-and-csrf-vulnerabilities-in-the-in_place_editing-plugin)
-   [Ticket \#1137](/issues/1137): 'Add "tweet" model for blog sidebar'
-   [Ticket \#1235](/issues/1235): "Viewing a forum topic, "updated at" shows last reply date"
-   [Ticket \#1213](/issues/1213): "Update backend to Rails 2.3.0 RC1"
-   [Ticket \#1210](/issues/1210): "Write JavaScript for dynamic "relativization" of displayed dates"
-   [Ticket \#1209](/issues/1209): "Scope refinement while navigating the tag cloud"

# February 2009

I've been a bit slack about updating this page. Some notable changes that have made it onto the production server:

-   [Ticket \#1199](/issues/1199): 'Private items' influence visible on "tags\#show" page'
-   [Ticket \#1198](/issues/1198): "Automatically record issue metadata changes in comments"
-   [Ticket \#1190](/issues/1190): "Very long form content gets truncated during post"
-   [Ticket \#1136](/issues/1136): "Add tag support to issue tracker"

Here is a list of the commits made between 27 April 2008 and 1 February 2009:

# 27 April 2008

-   Roll out basic prototype of full-text search: at the moment, weblog posts, wiki articles, issue tracker tickets and forum topics are all indexed, but comments attached to them are not.

# 23 April 2008

-   Fix destructive indenting by [Haml](/wiki/Haml) when re-editing in the "new issue" form (visible as unwanted indenting when redisplaying the form, as will happen when you supply invalid input and the validation fails)

# 21 April 2008

-   Fix "last post" information on topics with an anonymous last commenter (see [bug \#671](/issues/671))
-   Lots of [CSS](/wiki/CSS) tweaks and improvements

# 17 April 2008

-   [CSS](/wiki/CSS):
    -   changed to add a grey border around the main content of the area for the page, give the pages a less crowded appearance
    -   Added underlining to headings in several places to improve visual separation between different page sections
-   Easy-to-use and flexible search added to the [issue tracker](/wiki/issue_tracker)
-   The [Atom](/wiki/Atom) feed for the blog is now page-cached (not really a user-visible change, but it means that you can hit the feed more often without running into performance issues)
-   Improve navigation between pages in the issue tracker and support index by adding more links and making them more prominent
-   Add breadcrumbs to the [forum](/wiki/forum) index (the topic index and individual topic pages already had this)
-   Add breadcrumbs to individual weblog post pages

# 16 April 2008

-   Use "fuzzy matching" for forum comment dates; this eliminates repetitious labels like "Posted 2 days ago, edited 2 days ago" (this would be reduced to just "Posted 2 days ago", or just "2 days ago" when combined with the other changes to make dates more concise)
-   Use more concise date formats; cuts down on repeated "noise" words on the page
