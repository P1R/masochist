[TTL](/wiki/TTL) or "[Time To Live](/wiki/Time_To_Live)" is a time interval used for indicating the time at which a resource expires or should be considered expired. A TTL is essentially an advisory indication which indicates that a piece of data _should_ be discarded, but obviously it is left to the system that is in possession of the data to actually act upon the recommendation.
