# Release notes

    = Rake 0.7.3 Released

    Rake version 0.7.3 is a minor release that includes some refactoring to better
    support custom Rake applications.

    == Changes

    === New Features in Version 0.7.3

    * Added the +init+ and +top_level+ methods to make the creation of custom Rake applications a bit easier.  E.g.

        gem 'rake', ">= 0.7.3"
        require 'rake'

        Rake.application.init('myrake')

        task :default do
          something_interesting
        end

        Rake.application.top_level

    == What is Rake

    Rake is a build tool similar to the make program in many ways. But instead of
    cryptic make recipes, Rake uses standard Ruby code to declare tasks and
    dependencies. You have the full power of a modern scripting language built
    right into your build tool.

    == Availability

    The easiest way to get and install rake is via RubyGems ...

      gem install rake    (you may need root/admin privileges)

    Otherwise, you can get it from the more traditional places:

    Home Page:: http://rake.rubyforge.org/
    Download::  http://rubyforge.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=50

    == Thanks

    As usual, it was input from users that drove a alot of these changes. The
    following people either contributed patches, made suggestions or made
    otherwise helpful comments. Thanks to ...
