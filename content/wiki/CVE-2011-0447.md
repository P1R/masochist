There is a vulnerability in Ruby on Rails which could allow an attacker to circumvent the CSRF protection provided. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE Identifier CVE-2011-0447.

    Versions Affected:  2.1.0 and above
    Not affected:       Applications which don't use the built in CSRF
    protection.
    Fixed Versions:     3.0.4, 2.3.11

    Impact
    ------

    Certain combinations of browser plugins and HTTP redirects can be used
    to trick the user's browser into making cross-domain requests which
    include arbitrary HTTP headers specified by the attacker.  An attacker
    can utilise this to spoof ajax and API requests and bypass the built in
    CSRF protection and successfully attack an application.  All users
    running an affected release should upgrade or apply the patches immediately.

    Releases
    --------

    The 3.0.4 and 2.3.11 releases are available at the normal locations.

    Upgrade Process
    ---------------

    There are two major changes in this fix,  the behaviour when CSRF
    protection fails has changed and the token will now be required for
    *all* non-GET requests.

    After applying this patch failed CSRF requests will no longer generate
    HTTP 500 errors, instead the session will be reset.  Users can override
    this behaviour by overriding +handle_unverified_request+ in their own
    controllers.

    Users must still take care that users cannot be auto logged in via
    non-session data.  For example, an application using filters to
    implement 'remember me' functionality must either remove those cookies
    in their +handle_unverified_request+ handlers or ensure that the
    remember me code is only executed on GET requests.  A custom handler
    which removes the remember_me cookie would look like:

     def handle_unverified_request
        super # call the default behaviour which resets the session
        cookies.delete(:remember_me) # remove the auto login cookie so the
    fraudulent request is rejected.
     end

    There are two steps to ensuring that your application sends the CSRF
    Token with every ajax request.  Providing the token in a meta tag,  then
    ensuring your javascript reads those values and provides them with each
    request.  The first step involves you including the +csrf_meta_tag+
    helper somewhere in your application's layout.  Rails 3 applications
    likely already include this helper, however it has now been backported
    to the 2.3.x series.  An example of its use would be something like this
    in application.html.erb:

     <%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>
     <%= csrf_meta_tag %>

    In addition to altering the templates, an application's javascript must
    be changed to send the token with Ajax requests.  Rails 3 applications
    can just update their rails.js file using +rake rails:upgrade+, 2.x
    applications which don't use the built-in ajax view helpers will need to
    add a framework-specific snippet to their application.js.  Examples of
    those snippets are available:

    * prototype-snippet.js - Prototype script which includes the csrf token
    in every Ajax request
    * jquery-snippet.js - JQuery script which includes the csrf token in
    every Ajax request.

    Workarounds
    -----------

    There are no feasible workarounds for this vulnerability.

    Patches
    -------

    To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided
    patches for the two supported release series.  They are in git-am
    format, 3-0-csrf.patch includes two changesets, the others consist of a
    single changeset.

    * 2-3-csrf.patch - Patch for 2.3 series
    * 3-0-csrf.patch - Patch for 3.0 series

    Given the severity of the problem we are also providing backported fixes
    to the 2.2 and 2.1 series. There will be no gem releases for these
    versions but the stable branches in git will be updated.

    * 2-2-csrf.patch - Patch for 2.2 series
    * 2-1-csrf.patch - Patch for 2.1 series

    Please note that only the 2.3.x and 3.0.x series are supported at
    present.  Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade
    as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee continued security fixes
    indefinitely.
