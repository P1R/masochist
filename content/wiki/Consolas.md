At the time of writing you can get an [OS X](/wiki/OS_X) installer for the excellent [Consolas](/wiki/Consolas) programming front by installing Microsoft's "Open XML File Format Converter for Mac" from here:

-   <http://www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads>

At the time of writing the direct link to 1.2.1 is:

-   <http://www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads?pid=Mactopia_AddTools&fid=9796588D-238F-4694-9598-1AA8D2BECB55>

Once you've got the installer, you can extract the font from the package as described [here](http://www.wezm.net/technical/2010/08/howto-install-consolas-font-mac/). (In short, you inspect the package contents and install the "OpenXML_all_fonts.pkg" from the `Contents/Resources` subdirectory.)

For Windows, I'm told this link might work:

-   <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17879>

**Note:** As shipped from Microsoft, it appears there is a problem with the baseline setting on the font. See "[Fixing the baseline on the Consolas font on OS X](/wiki/Fixing_the_baseline_on_the_Consolas_font_on_OS_X)" for details on how it can be fixed.
