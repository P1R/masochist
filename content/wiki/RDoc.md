[RDoc](/wiki/RDoc) is, or was, the _de facto_ standard for producing documentation from code comments embedded inline in [Ruby](/wiki/Ruby) and [C](/wiki/C) extension code. At the time of writing (October 2010) it is rapidly being displaced by superior alternatives such as [YARD](/wiki/YARD).

Principal criticisms of RDoc include:

-   slow
-   buggy
-   inconsistent
-   stagnated development
-   ugly default output
-   brittle parser extremely sensitive to input variation
-   large disparity between capabilities of Ruby parser and C parser, making documentation for C extensions in C files basically infeasible
-   inadequate escaping options
