I first set up remote backups between [RHEL](/wiki/RHEL) (specifically, RHEL 3) and [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) back in 2006 ([Tiger](/wiki/Tiger), if I recall correctly), and detailed that process in "[Remote backups via rsync between RHEL 3 and Mac OS X](/wiki/Remote_backups_via_rsync_between_RHEL_3_and_Mac_OS_X)".

These notes refer to my experiences in 2009, this time with [RHEL](/wiki/RHEL) 5.3 and [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) 10.5.7 [Leopard](/wiki/Leopard).

# Objective

Our objective is to connect from our client machine ([Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X)) via [SSH](/wiki/SSH) to perform an [rsync](/wiki/rsync) backup of critical files on a remote [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux) machine.

# Initial client-side setup

First of all let's see what version of [rsync](/wiki/rsync) we have on the client side ([Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) 10.5.7 [Leopard](/wiki/Leopard):

```shell
$ whereis rsync
/usr/bin/rsync
$ rsync --version
rsync  version 2.6.9  protocol version 29

Capabilities: 64-bit files, socketpairs, hard links, symlinks, batchfiles,
              inplace, IPv6, 32-bit system inums, 64-bit internal inums

# Initial server-side setup

How does this compare with what's available on the server ([RHEL](/wiki/RHEL) 5.3)?

```shell
# yum list rsync
Loaded plugins: rhnplugin
Excluding Packages in global exclude list
Finished
Available Packages
rsync.i386                                                2.6.8-3.1                                                rhel-i386-server-5
```

I know from my experience last time ("[Remote backups via rsync between RHEL 3 and Mac OS X](/wiki/Remote_backups_via_rsync_between_RHEL_3_and_Mac_OS_X)") that version 2.6.8 must also speak "protocol version 29", so let's try installing that:

# yum install rsync

# Key set-up

I'll be using the key pair that I generated [last time](/wiki/Remote_backups_via_rsync_between_RHEL_3_and_Mac_OS_X), so there is no need to do anything on the client side.

On the server side I'm going to add my public key to root's `authorized_keys` file. First, upload the public key file from the local client to the server:

```shell
$ scp ~/.ssh/id_dsa_rsync.pub remoteuser@example.com:/home/remoteuser/.ssh
```

Back on the server, append this to the `authorized_keys` file for root:

```shell
# sudo cat /home/remoteuser/id_dsa_rsync.pub >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

And we customize the `authorized_keys` file by prepending this to the line in the file which corresponds to the key that we just added:

    command="rsync --server --daemon .",no-port-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty

# Testing the connection

Seeing as I'm running [Bansshee](/wiki/Bansshee) I could get temporarily locked out of the server if I make too many failed connection attempts while testing, so I am going to turn it off temporarily:

```shell
# service bansshee stop
Stopping banshee:                                          [  OK  ]
```

Now let's create a test directory and run some trials:

```shell
$ cd /tmp
mkdir rsync-test
$ rsync -e "ssh -i /Users/testuser/.ssh/id_dsa_rsync" -avzxn --numeric-ids --delete --progress root@example.com:/ /tmp/rsync-test
rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [receiver]
rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at /SourceCache/rsync/rsync-35.2/rsync/io.c(452) [receiver=2.6.9]
```

Find out if any extraneous output is causing problems:

```shell
$ ssh root@example.com echo -n 2>/dev/null > out.dat
$ cat out.dat
```

Try a simpler test case:

```shell
$ rsync -e ssh -avzxn --numeric-ids --delete --progress non-root-user@example.com:/ /tmp/rsync-test
receiving file list ...
rsync: opendir "/package/admin/clear/supervise" failed: Permission denied (13)
...
sent 55244 bytes  received 267877 bytes  34012.74 bytes/sec
total size is 238451640  speedup is 737.96
rsync error: some files could not be transferred (code 23) at /SourceCache/rsync/rsync-35.2/rsync/main.c(1400) [generator=2.6.9]
```

Create `/root/debug.sh`:

    #!/bin/sh
    echo "$SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND" > /tmp/debug.out

And stick that in the forced command specification of the `authorized_keys` file before trying the `rsync` invocation again. Now inspect the output of `/tmp/debug.out`:

```shell
# cat /tmp/debug.out
rsync --server --sender -vnlogDtprxz --numeric-ids . /
```

So this is identical to the output that I saw back in 2006. Update the forced command specification accordingly and try again.

It works. Note that my first test run, still using the `-n` switch, produced this:

    receiving file list ...
    9778 files to consider
    ./
    Invalid checksum length -1610612736 [sender]
    rsync error: protocol incompatibility (code 2) at io.c(958) [sender=2.6.8]
    rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (223620 bytes received so far) [receiver]
    rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at /SourceCache/rsync/rsync-35.2/rsync/io.c(452) [receiver=2.6.9]
    rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (223614 bytes received so far) [generator]
    rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at /SourceCache/rsync/rsync-35.2/rsync/io.c(452) [generator=2.6.9]

Which basically was the exact same problem we saw in 2006.

But removing the `-n` switch we instead get:

    receiving file list ...
    9778 files to consider
    ./
    .autofsck
               0 100%    0.00kB/s    0:00:00 (xfer#1, to-check=9776/9778)

# Scripting the backup

So our manual test run worked, all that remains is to whip up a script to automate it a little.

# Clean up

Turn [Bansshee](/wiki/Bansshee) back on:

```shell
# service bansshee start
Starting banshee:                                          [  OK  ]
```
