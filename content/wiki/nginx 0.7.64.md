    Changes with nginx 0.7.64                                        16 Nov 2009

       *) Security: now SSL/TLS renegotiation is disabled.
          Thanks to Maxim Dounin.

       *) Bugfix: nginx sent gzipped responses to clients those do not support
          gzip, if "gzip_static on" and "gzip_vary off"; the bug had appeared
          in 0.7.63.

       *) Bugfix: if names .domain.tld, .sub.domain.tld, and .domain-some.tld
          were defined, then the name .sub.domain.tld was matched by
          .domain.tld.

       *) Bugfix: segmentation fault and infinite looping in resolver.

       *) Bugfix: in resolver.
          Thanks to Artem Bokhan.

       *) Bugfix: resolver cache poisoning.
          Thanks to Matthew Dempsky.

       *) Bugfix: memory leak in resolver.
