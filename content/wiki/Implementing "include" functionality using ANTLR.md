As of [changeset 3834](http://fisheye2.cenqua.com/changelog/antlr-examples/?cs=3834) in the [ANTLR examples](/wiki/ANTLR_examples) repository, the [C](/wiki/C) example shows how to use the new built-in stream stacking functionality in the [C target](/wiki/C_target) to implement "include" functionality.

Note that [ANTLR](/wiki/ANTLR) 3.0 does _not_ include the stream stacking support. Any version after [changeset 3839](http://fisheye2.cenqua.com/changelog/antlr/?cs=3839) should be fine, or [ANTLR 3.0.1](/wiki/ANTLR_3.0.1) when it is released (not yet released at the time of writing, 20 June 2007).

This supersedes the previous method (see '[Manually implementing "include" functionality using ANTLR](/wiki/Manually_implementing_%22include%22_functionality_using_ANTLR)').
