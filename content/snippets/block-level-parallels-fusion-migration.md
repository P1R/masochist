Wolf [jumps through hoops](http://rentzsch.com/notes/blocklevelParallelsFusionMigration) to keep his virtualized mail server running. But I'm puzzled as to _why_ he's doing this in a virtualized environment anyway. What can Debian do that — the obviously extremely-capable — Rentzsch can't get Max OS X to do?
