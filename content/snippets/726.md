Just learned about [Parslet](http://kschiess.github.com/parslet/), yet another Ruby [PEG](/wiki/PEG) implementation. Back when [Treetop](http://treetop.rubyforge.org/) came out a couple of years ago I remember thinking, meh, guess they didn't know about _my_ PEG implementation (see [Walrat](/wiki/Walrat)). Well, let's chalk up another one! I guess everybody has to build their own parser generator and/or compiler at some point; it's kind of a rite of passage. If anybody knows of any non-toy [examples](https://github.com/kschiess/parslet/tree/master/example/) it would be interesting to see them.
