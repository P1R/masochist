[Torvalds](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17) on [GitHub](/wiki/GitHub) pull requests:

> I don't do github pull requests.
>
> github throws away all the relevant information, like having even a valid email address for the person asking me to pull. The diffstat is also deficient and useless.
>
> Git comes with a nice pull-request generation module, but github instead decided to replace it with their own totally inferior version. As a result, I consider github useless for these kinds of things. It's fine for _hosting_, but the pull requests and the online commit editing, are just pure garbage.

More golden snippets from the thread:

-   "the braindamaged crap that github does when you ask it to request a pull"
-   "those commits are invariably pure crap"
-   "totally unreadable descriptions"
-   "github is a total ghetto of crap commit messages and unreadable and unusable pull requests"
-   "People should try to compare the quality of the kernel git logs with some other projects, and cry themselves to sleep."
-   "You're a moron."

> TL;DR Dumbass rails "developer" with zero community contributions of his own feels that a Github account qualifies him to comment on Linux kernel commits and gets called a moron by Linus. Reddit explodes.
