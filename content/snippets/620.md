Ok, I'm forced to officially admit that I _must_ get more sleep than the 5 hours per night I've been getting of late: I just found a page on my site that I published yesterday with this, er, "description" on it: "1-line description. Well, actually, can make it a fair bit longer than 1 line I think. But will limit it to three sentences, I'd say..." How embarrassing...
