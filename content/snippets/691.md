[Amazon Route 53](/wiki/Amazon_Route_53) is the new hosted [DNS](/wiki/DNS) service in Amazon's [cloud computing](/wiki/cloud_computing)Â empire. Like other parts of [AWS](/wiki/AWS), it's designed to be scalable and extremely economic ($1 per zone month, plus $0.50 per million queries, dropping to \$0.25 after the first billion). I'm currently using [Nettica](/wiki/Nettica), which is already high robust and quite cheap too, but it's nice to have options.
