Ruby micro-celebrity "why the lucky stiff", AKA "\_why", pulls as much of his Internet presence as possible (Twitter, GitHub accounts, personal sites) just over a month after having his "true identity" revealed [here](http://whoiswhytheluckystiff.wordpress.com/) ("Jonathan Gillette") and [furore ensues](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=773108). Numerous theories circulate seeking to explain the incident. I wonder why people make such a big deal out of online "identity" anyway, especially when on the Internet privacy is a fragile illusion at best, "truth" is a relative concept, and _who_ you are shouldn't matter so much as _what_ you do.
