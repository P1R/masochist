The process for submitting patches to the Rails documentation seems a bit crazy to me. [Patches](https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/5007) to the official Rails repo are rejected and you're told to push into a world-writable fork of the Rails repo. These changes are then periodically merged back in to the real repo. Crazy because it short-circuits the normal review process, and having to sift through looking for _legitimate_ documentation patches among all the others seems like an awfully error-prone process. Who does the review? And how?
