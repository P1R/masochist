My US bank is paying me 0.01% interest for the money in my savings account. If I were to switch to a CD (certificate of deposit) I could get as much as 0.25% over a 12-month term. My Australian bank pays 4.5%. That's _18 times_ as much as the US CD rate, and _450 times_ as much as the basic savings account rate.
