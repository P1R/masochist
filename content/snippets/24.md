Look at commit 42e0f26 for evidence of a breach of discipline on my part. Out of habit, I was working directly on the master branch when [news of a security vulnerability](/snippets/19) in the Mail gem used by [Rails](/wiki/Rails) persuaded me to do [a hasty deployment](/snippets/20), even though I suspected that in my app the vulnerability in the gem was unlikely to be exploitable.

The breach of discipline referred to above was that I was working on the master branch when I should have been on a topic branch. I had a bunch of commits already pushed out, but the feature was not yet completed, so I couldn't use the tip of the master branch for deployment purposes.

Now I _could_ have created another branch containing only the fix (eg. "security") and then deployed that, but I didn't really want to create another branch in the repo that I would then be obliged to keep around forever.

So I created a new branch for my topic (that's the "unobtrusive" branch mentioned in the commit message for 42e0f26) and then rewound the master branch and applied the security fix. This required a forced update when pushing, something which I only allowed myself to do because I am the sole consumer of this particular repo.

Once all this was done, I was free to merge the changes on the master branch into the "unobtrusive" topic branch (although I could have just rebased too, and perhaps I should have in order to hide this little slip up on my part). Finally when the topic was finished I could just merge the "unobtrusive" topic branch back into "master" and delete the former.

Lessons learned?

-   be more disciplined about using topic branches when starting on features or refactorings that will take many commits to complete
-   consider reviving the old "maint" branch that I used to use and keeping it around for these cases where you need to deploy a one-commit fix _right now_

It's funny. I stopped using the "maint" branch a while back because I thought it was a mistake (see [my blog post](/blog/thoughts-on-staging-environments-and-branches-for-web-apps), "Thoughts on staging environments and branches for web apps").

Now I'm thinking that I wasn't quite right there; while it's true that equating "master" with "staging" and "maint" with "production" is a mistake, I think this little episode clearly demonstrates the utility of having a "maint" branch which closely tracks the "master" branch, usually lagging a little behind (at the previously deployed commit) so that you can easily push out quick fixes when required. Keeping this kind of branch is dead easy in [Git](/wiki/Git), seeing as it will basically always be fast-forwarded.
