Perforce [announces "Git Fusion"](http://www.perforce.com/git-fusion) in a gibe-filled product page. As far as I can tell, few _voluntarily_ use Perforce; if Git could somehow be adapted to better handle enormous non-source-code assets (eg. gigabytes or terabytes of media) then there'd be no reason for Perforce to exist. People are working on it.
