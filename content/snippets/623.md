[Cucumber](/wiki/Cucumber) has a large fan base, but it also has a growing number of critics [like this one](http://afewgoodlines.com/post/1077316188/integration-testing-retrospective-part-i), and has spawned a number of aggressively different alternatives like [Steak](/wiki/Steak) too, which explicit reject Cucumber's key tenets. I don't want to offend [Aslak Helles√∏y](http://github.com/aslakhellesoy) or any of the Cucumber contributors who have collectively invested thousands of man-hours in developing Cucumber, but from my perspective, it's **_the worst thing that ever happened to Ruby testing_**. The best thing? [RSpec](/wiki/RSpec), despite a couple of dark moments. The neatest, perhaps [RR](/wiki/RR). Well-deserved gold stars also go to [Capybara](/wiki/Capybara) and [Factory Girl](/wiki/Factory_Girl).
