Awesome: "as of today, all Amazon EC2 instances come with free Basic Monitoring metrics from our Monitoring service, Amazon CloudWatch". And also, "starting today you can now set alarms for any metric that Amazon CloudWatch monitors. You can configure these alarms via API call to send notifications or initiate Auto Scaling actions when metrics cross certain thresholds. Alarm pricing starts at \$0.10 per alarm per month."
