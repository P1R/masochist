Safari periodically forgets, _en masse_, which RSS articles I've already looked at causing all of my feeds to simultaneously indicate new articles. I then have to display all the feeds to reset the unread counters back to zero. Very annoying, seeing as it entirely defeats the purpose of RSS (ie. bringing sites to your attention only when they update). This is evidently an Apple bug and not a case of the remote sites changing the timestamps on their feeds, seeing as this happens to all the feeds at once. I hope Apple fixes this soon.
