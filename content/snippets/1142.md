This one was a bit scary. Total freeze when typing in Chrome. I figured perhaps the battery had gone flat without warning me (turns out, no, I was around 80% full). Open up machine plugged in: black screen, fans on. 15 mins later, [hard reset](/wiki/Hard_reset). Machine boots up multiple times (?) and lands me in the "Reset Password" app. Reboot. White text on black screen (progress output, not a [kernel panic](/wiki/Kernel_panic). Worrying.
