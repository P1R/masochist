As I [mentioned yesterday](/twitter/92), there has finally been official word that [TextMate](/wiki/TextMate) 2 is apparently not dead after all.

If you look at [the official post](http://blog.macromates.com/2009/working-on-it/) you'll see lots of supportive comments and not too many references to [Vim](/wiki/Vim) and [Emacs](/wiki/Emacs). If you head over to the [Reddit article](http://blog.macromates.com/2009/working-on-it/) you'll see a _lot_ more such references.

A common thread seems to be that many TextMate users migrated away due to frustration at the glacial pace of development, and furthermore, that once they'd gone _there was no way they could be won back_.

This is an interesting phenomenon, and one that can't be explained away by recourse to mere stubbornness or vengefulness. Embracing [Vim](/wiki/Vim) (or [Emacs](/wiki/Emacs)) really does seem to be a pseudo-religious experience in that it is akin to "seeing the light" or "being born again". Once you've experienced it it's awfully hard to contemplate going back to your former state.

I personally won't be going back for three reasons:

1.  My experience with [Vim](/wiki/Vim) has convinced me that its modal editing paradigm is the most efficient and pleasant one available.
2.  Even if TextMate 2 shipped with a special modal "Vim compatibility" mode, it would lack the nearly infinite configurability that Vim (and of course Emacs) offers.
3.  TextMate's closed source model is fundamentally broken compared to the [open source](/wiki/open_source) one of Vim and Emacs; the latter products will never suffer from frustrated userbases leaving in droves due to lack of development. Being open source, if people are frustrated about a missing feature then there is nothing stopping them from implementing it themselves. (In any case, going back to point \#2 again, actually hacking on the source is seldom required because these products are so much more customizable by nature.)

TextMate 2 can certainly be a great commercial success, it can provide an ideal editing experience for many kinds of users, and it can also be a proving ground for whatever brilliant new ideas Allan Odgaard might have floating around in his head, _but_ as long as it remains closed source I think it's doomed to (relative) failure in the long term.
