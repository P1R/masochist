Is [Vim](/wiki/Vim) better than [Emacs](/wiki/Emacs)?

No frickin' way!

But I _like_ it better.

How has it won me over so quickly? Well, basically because as I use it I feel like I am working with a wise and reliable friend that's trying to help me get stuff done in the most efficient manner possible.

With Emacs, I feel like I'm working with a tool that I had to assemble myself from 236 different pieces, guided by instructions written in an academic but antiquated style, and constantly aware that all of this could be faster but isn't yet because I haven't finished the university degree in advanced tool construction yet.

### Update

If you feel like a laugh, try issuing the command, `:help!`, in Vim.
