title: The Rails-doesn't-scale "myth"
tags: blog
---

[Rails doesn't scale](http://www.google.com/search?q=rails+doesn't+scale), or so the saying goes. Ah, [that's just a myth](http://www.google.com/search?q=rails+doesn't+scale+myth), [they say](http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000596.html). [Don't worry about it](http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/fear_shark_attacks_and_will_it_scale.php), argue others.

[Now this](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/2/4/joyent-makes-rails-app-go-to-4-000-req-sec), 4,000 requests per second. _Of course_ if you [throw enough money at the problem](http://joyeur.com/2007/02/04/a-brief-update-with-some-numbers-for-hardware-load-balanced-mongrels) Rails will "scale". But didn't we already know that?
