title: Involuntary Reboot log #5
tags: involuntary.reboot.log blog
---

Much like [last time]() but with an updated version of the OS, again a panic on boot. Tried unplugging the USB cable connecting the UPS and was able to boot.

Disk Utility reported one error on the volume containing the fresh install, "Incorrect number of Access Control Lists". I rebooted into my previous install and tried to repair but was told that it didn't work; on verifying again it said the error was no longer present.

#### Notes about day calculations

Rather than hurting my brain by trying to manually work out date intervals and mean time between failures, I used the interactive Ruby interpreter, `irb`:

    require 'date'
    today = Date.today
    start = Date.new(2006, 5, 21)
    today - start
    147 / 5
