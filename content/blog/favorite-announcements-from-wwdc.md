Favorite stuff to come out of [WWDC](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/wwdc06/):

-   Improved [Spotlight](http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/spotlight.html) in [Leopard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/); sounds like it will go from "shows potential but sucks" to "totally indispensable tool that enables you to do amazing stuff really quickly".
-   [Spaces](http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/spaces.html): Exposé is good but Exposé plus Spaces will be even better. Combine all this with the already great built-in application switcher and the Dock and you have a system which is incredibly easy to move around and be productive in.
-   [Time Machine](http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/timemachine.html) (I strongly suspect that this is built on [ZFS](http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=14473)). I do daily backups anyway, but this is still cool.
-   Intel kernel sources [available in full](http://kernel.macosforge.org/) and [Xcode 3.0](http://kernel.macosforge.org/intel-build-instructions.html%3Every%20easy%20to%20build%3C/a%3E.%3C/li%3E%0A%3Cli%3E%3Ca%20href=) (so, we've got our hands on 2.4 already but nothing overwhelming there).
-   Objective-C 2.0 with garbage collection and "syntax improvements" (wonder what they are).
-   [Display](http://www.apple.com/displays/) prices have dropped massively.
-   The new [Mac Pros](http://www.apple.com/macpro/): I'll be trying to save money for one of these before Leopard ships. The performance of my iMac is great; the performance of the new machines must be _stunning_.

And finally:

-   Mighty Mouse Wireless (OK, this one was announced before WWDC).
