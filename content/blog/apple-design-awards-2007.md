So the winners of the Apple Design Awards for 2007 have been [announced](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/ada/).

### Leopard

For me, the most remarkable thing about the awards this year is that there is a category for applications which run on an operating system that won't even be released until October this year.

Will Shipley has apparently been able to develop an application that uses:

-   Core Data - Stores thousands of library assets and increases overall performance
-   Core Animation - Adds animation throughout the interface and removes thousands of lines of custom animation code
-   Calendar Store - The Calendar Store framework assists the integration with iCal
-   Scripting Bridge - Directly communicates with iWeb for web publishing and with iTunes to obtain album cover art, thus reducing its hardware footprint
-   Spotlight - Enhanced Spotlight integration and the NSPredicateEditor UI enables smart shelves
-   Core Image - Allows visual effects to be applied to cover art and used throughout the UI
-   Image IO - Handles reading & parsing images of various formats

This is the next most interesting thing about the award results: those of you without access to the Leopard seeds can deduce from this that they are stable enough to produce a massive, complex application in Objective-C using the supplied developer tools. Either that or Will Shipley has the patience of a saint. Or he's a genius.
