[According](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/14/web20rhea_funding/) to [The Register](http://theregister.co.uk), Twitter's business model is basically "selling themselves to Google".

An interesting idea. Seeking to follow in the steps of YouTube, I gather.

As the article says, Twitter "pulls in exactly zero dollars a month in revenue", but they just got another \$35 million in venture capital, apparently without even looking for it (seeing as "significant capital from last year's partnership with is still in the bank"... certainly inspires confidence to know that they haven't burnt through all their savings yet despite their zero-revenue model.)

Things that happen on the Internet never cease to amaze me.
