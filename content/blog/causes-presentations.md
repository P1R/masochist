Over the last year and a half at [Causes](/wiki/Causes) I've given a number of tech and lightning talks. I've just spent some time putting them online under my "work" [GitHub](/wiki/GitHub) profile, <https://github.com/ghurrell> (my other profile containing non-work projects is <https://github.com/wincent>).

**Update:** _Since writing this posted I've consolidated those GitHub accounts into [one](https://github.com/wincent). The links below are therefore out of date, but the repos can all be found [in the consolidated account](https://github.com/wincent?tab=repositories)._

In roughly reverse chronological order, they are:

-   <http://ghurrell.github.com/git-filter-branch-lightning-talk/> ("How to open-source your repo without open-sourcing your repo"; describes how to automatically maintain an [open source](/wiki/open_source) fork of a subset of an otherwise closed repo using `git-filter-branch` and friends; [source](https://github.com/ghurrell/git-filter-branch-lightning-talk))
-   <http://ghurrell.github.com/migrating-rails-with-a-large-codebase-presentation/> (story of how we went from Rails 2.1.0 to the latest Rails 3.2.x in a large codebase; [YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgCM2bca49w); [source](https://github.com/ghurrell/migrating-rails-with-a-large-codebase-presentation))
-   <http://ghurrell.github.com/testable-js-lightning-talk/> (on how to architect [JavaScript](/wiki/JavaScript) for testability; [source](https://github.com/ghurrell/testable-js-lightning-talk))
-   <http://peaceful-journey-2015.herokuapp.com/> (Compass lightning talk demo, actually a micro-app; [source](https://github.com/ghurrell/compass-lightning-talk))
-   <http://ghurrell.github.com/rails-3-lightning-talk/> (a lightning talk on view escaping in Rails 3; [source](https://github.com/ghurrell/rails-3-lightning-talk))
-   <http://ghurrell.github.com/seven-languages-prolog-tech-talk> (the week I led in our "Seven Languages in Seven Weeks" reading group, Prolog; [demo code](https://github.com/ghurrell/seven-languages-prolog-tech-talk))
-   <http://ghurrell.github.com/gerrit-best-practices-tech-talk> (a follow-up on how to get the most out of Gerrit)
-   <http://ghurrell.github.com/gerrit-intro-tech-talk> (an intro for the team made when we started using [Gerrit](/wiki/Gerrit) for code review)
-   <http://ghurrell.github.com/git-submodules-tech-talk> (this one also covers some Git fundamentals)
