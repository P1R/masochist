I'm currently looking at getting a better microphone to do screencasts. The one I'm most interested in goes for between $84 and $100 in the US (57€ to 68€). Purchased locally here in Spain the mic goes for upwards of 130€.

Unfortunately, most of the retailers in the US don't want to ship outside of the US. I found one who would: they quoted me over $160 shipping, plus $50 wire transfer fee (they don't accept foreign credit cards) and the cost of the mic on top of that for a _grand_ total of \$294. Ridiculous. That's 200€. Needless to say I'll be holding off until I find a better option.

My past experiences ordering computer components from the US have always been excellent, but it seems that things are different in the audio realm.

### Update

Found a [reasonably priced European supplier](http://www.thomann.de/).
