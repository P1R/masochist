So, Microsoft "[quietly ditches](http://www.betanews.com/article/Microsoft_Quietly_Ditches_WMP_for_Mac/1137014055)" Windows Media Player for Mac:

> Despite pledging its support for Apple's platform, Microsoft has backed out of future releases of Windows Media Player for Mac, and the company's Web site now directs visitors to download a third-party application from developer [Flip4Mac](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/flip4mac.mspx).

Disappointing. The Mac version of Windows Media Player was always terrible (slow, hideous UI) but this third-party alternative seems little better. I did download and try out the trial version but it was plagued by horrible slowness and lag issues on my 1GHz G4 PowerBook, rendering it _even less_ usable than the Microsoft player (now _that's_ saying something).

QuickTime is a superior format and player, but there's still a lot of Windows Media out there that needs to be played, and unfortunately not all of it plays in the [VideoLAN Client](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/).
