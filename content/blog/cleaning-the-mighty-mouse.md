title: Cleaning the Mighty Mouse

I've tried almost every trick in the book when it comes to cleaning the [Mighty Mouse's](http://www.apple.com/mightymouse/) non-functioning scroll ball.

Ultimately though, no matter what you do, there _will_ come a day in which the ball stops working completely no matter what you do and the only thing that can resurrect it will be invasive surgery.

When that happens to you, I recommend you check out [this video](http://www.veoh.com/videos/v378809PrA5a3pg) showing you how to take it apart and put it back together. Once you get right down inside the scroll ball component and see the black gunk bonded to the magnetic rollers, you'll see that there is no way to clean it without taking it apart.

So thankfully, after over a week without scrolling functionality in any direction, I'm happy to have a working scroll ball again.

Despite their diminutive size, manipulating the rollers isn't the hardest part, provided you have on hand a set of tweezers or needle-nose pliers. The hardest part is actually plugging the darn ribbon cables back in. A real pain if you've got big fingers like me.

Needless to say, I didn't super-glue the body ring back on afterwards. Something tells me I'll be needing to take it off again all too soon.
