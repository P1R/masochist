title: Musings on Subversion, SVK and Git

So lately the [Subversion log](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/) has been quiet, because I've been doing a lot of development work in a private (local-only) [SVK](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK) sandbox. This is great for trying things out but it also means that regular progress updates aren't instantly available to customers.

So last night I stopped working in the sandbox and [imported the results](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/2007/07/wocommon_r633_13_items_changed.php) back into the main repository, which means that subsequent changes ([starting here](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/2007/07/wocommon_r634_1_item_changed.php)) will be visible to the public eye.

This temporary lack of communication bothers me, and the lack of remote backup also bothers me: when the repository is on a remote machine you automatically get some redundancy (remote repository, local [SVK](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK) mirror, local [SVK](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK) working copy, or copies); but when you work on a local-only branch your only redundancy comes from your daily backups to DVD-R.

So far I've been _very_ impressed with [SVK](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK)'s [branching](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/branching) and [merging](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/merging) but I am also worried that it might not be entirely bullet-proof. I haven't been bitten yet, but I occasionally see reports on the [svk-devel](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/svk-devel) mailing list about wedged repositories and merge bugs and that worries me.

Also, it's quite slow. [Git](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git), on the other hand, seems solid as a rock and incredibly fast by all reports. I also couldn't get [SVK](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK) installed on [Leopard](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard) the last time I tried, thus forcing me to go back to the mergeless world of vanilla [Subversion](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Subversion); [SVK](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK), like many other big [Perl](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Perl) applications, sometimes resembles a teetering stack of fragile components with unfathomable interdependencies. [Git](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git) on the other hand is lightweight, portable [C](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/C). And now that I have multiple branches for the different versions of [Mac OS X](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Mac%20OS%20X), reliability and functionality across [Tiger](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Tiger) and [Leopard](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard), as well as robustness of merging is increasingly important.

So I think the writing is on the wall for [SVK](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK). It seems inevitable that I'll move, sooner or later, to [Git](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git). There are still a couple of gaps that would need to be filled in, but 90% of what I need is there. [This looks to be a nice tutorial](http://utsl.gen.nz/talks/git-svn/intro.html) for [Subversion](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Subversion) users looking to move to [Git](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git), especially those who are already familiar with distributed [version control](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/version%20control) thanks to their experience with [SVK](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK).
