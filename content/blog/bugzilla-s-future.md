I think [this bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=540#c95) is a typical indication that [Bugzilla](/wiki/Bugzilla)'s days a numbered, despite the fact that it was once "_the_" bug-tracking king and is _still_ "_the_" bug tracker used by [many](http://www.bugzilla.org/installation-list/) enormously popular software projects (like lots of Linux distros, Open Office and myriad other [open source](/wiki/open_source) projects):

> It's coming up to the 10 year mark since this bug was created...

And the bug is still marked as "NEW".

That particular issue linked to above isn't the reason why I dropped Bugzilla in favor of my own custom [issue tracker](/wiki/issue_tracker) built on [Rails](/wiki/Rails) — my main concerns were ease of use and better integration with the other parts of the site — but I think that that ticket is a good example of the glacial pace at which Bugzilla is evolving. The competitors are too numerous, too innovative and too agile for Bugzilla to rest on its laurels, much like [Subversion](/wiki/Subversion)'s distributed competitors (and [Git](/wiki/Git) more than all the others combined) are dancing circles around it while Subversion lumbers forward like a sleepy bear struggling to wake up from hibernation.

I would say that Bugzilla needs to do something or die, but it clearly already is dying and it's only a matter of time before it fades away into obsolescence.
